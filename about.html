        <h2 class="heading bg-white gutter">HOW I GOT HERE</h2>
            
            <div class="bio">
                
                <p>Like most people, my life has not been without its challenges. As a result, I spent most of my childhood getting lost in books and expressing myself creatively. Books taught me that I wasn’t alone—that everyone has a story. Art taught me how to tell my own.</p> 

                <p>I realized I wanted to be an artist in the 5th grade when a project I was presenting prompted excitement and gasps. I knew that my future would be crafted by my own hands.</p>

                <p>But I wandered through self-doubt, trying my hand at almost everything except Art. Finally, I found a balance between academics and creativity that worked for me: Communication and Creative Writing.</p>

                <p>My career post-college was full of interesting adventures that took me from Austin, to Chicago and finally to New York City - but even when I found myself in less creative settings throughout my jobs, I pursued creative outlets in external communities everywhere I went. My free time was filled with volunteering, starting my own blog, and taking sewing and pattern design classes. Having met my needs, I was beginning to rediscover what I truly wanted.</p>

                <p>And that’s how I discovered UX Design.</p>

                <p>As I filled my weekends sewing quilts, learning how to illustrate and produce my own fabric, or planning my next blog entry, I started to generate new ideas. And ideas have always driven me to the same place: books. It was in the pages of Steven Pressfield’s “The War of Art” and a handful of memoirs detailing the journeys of innovative minds and companies that I admire, that I started to envision how I could build something of my own—something that could bring both purpose and joy.</p> 

                <p>And that vision brought me to Bloc, a web design and coding program where I studied the crucial steps of the design process, including the importance of crafted research, communication, and recognizing the needs of others. The ability to meet these needs is a carefully tuned reflex strengthened by my years of caring for others.</p>   

                <p>But most importantly, I learn visual and programming skills I didn’t believe I was capable of learning before. And for me, that’s the value of UX Design: it provides the tools to make a difference.</p>

                <p>As a new designer I hope to be able to continue learning, to approach each new problem as an opportunity, and explore the possibilities that have only recently reached my imagination. I’m interested in supportive internship or work opportunities at companies that use their influence to promote positive change.</p>
